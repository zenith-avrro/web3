// Smart Contract 
-- Smart Contracts are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary.


// Blockchain
-- A blockchain is a distrubuted digital ledger-a continiously growing chain of data records(called blocks) that are cyptographically liked to the provious one, making the history temper-resistant.


// Web3
-- Web3 is the next evolution of the internet, built on decentralized technology like blockchain,cryptocurrency,smart contracts and peer-to-peer network.

// Mining 
-- The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. Miners solve complex math problems to earn reward usually cryptocurrency.

// Consensus Mechanism 
-- A rule that ensure all node in the network agree on the blockchain state. For example proof of work (POW) where miners solve puzzle and proof of stake(POS) where validators as chose based on their coin holding.


// Gas 
-- A fee paid to process transactions or smart contracts on network like ethereum.It prevent spam and manages network resources like a toll for using the blockchain.


// Stable Coin 
-- A stable coin is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to main a statble value, usually by being pegged to a reserve asset such as Fiat Currency(USD,EUR) or commodity(Gold) or even other crytpocurrencies.



// Front Running 
-- Front running is a type of exploit or attack where someone often about sports a pending transaction in the memepool and quickly places their own transaction before it, to profit from the expected market movement. 


// Arbitrage 
-- Arbritrage is a trading strategy where you buy an asset(like bitcoin or stablecoin) in one market at the lower price and simultaneously sell it in another market at the higher price, profiting from the price difference.


// Mainnet 
-- The fully developed and lauched blockchain network where main transactions occur.


// Testnet 
-- A separate blockchain network used by developers to test new features and application without risking the real funds on the mainnet. 

// RPCs 
-- An RPCs(Remote Procedure Call) allows your local appliction(like a web wallet or DApp) to communicate with a blockchain node/server without you needing to run your own full node.


// ECDSA 
-- ECDSA is a core cryptographic algorithms used in block-chain system like etherum, bitcoin, solana and many more ECDSA stand for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithms. It's a digital signature algorithms based on ECC(elliptic Curve Cryptograppy) which is used to sign transactions, verify signatures and prover ownership of private key without revealing them. 


// ED25519
--ED25519 is a modern,high-speed and secure public key signature system based on eliptic curve-cryptpgrapy. It's specially implements the Edwards-curve digital signature algorithms(EdDSA) using the twisted Edwards curve known as edwards 25519, which is closely related to the curve 25519.


// Program Derived Address(PDA)
-- In the solana blockchain,a PDA(Program Derived Address) is a special kind of account address-not controlled by private key but instead generated deterministically by a program(smart contract).

// EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
-- EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine.IT is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.

// Throughput
-- Throughtput refers to how many transactions a blockchain can process per second(TPS).Solana have the most throughput rate like 6000+ TPS.
